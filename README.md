## `tsconfig.json`

Configuring TypeScript files can be tedious. Lucky for us, devs in the community have already
created tools that help us out. One of these such tools is a
[repository](https://github.com/tsconfig/bases) that centralizes recommendations of the most common
TSConfig files, wherein we can find a pre-built config file that suits our needs. This is a great
starting point for any TypeScript project.
